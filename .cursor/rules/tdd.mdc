# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guidelines

## Core Principles

### 1. Always Ask Clarifying Questions
- **Before starting any implementation**, ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
- Seek additional detail on requirements, edge cases, or user expectations
- Better to over-communicate than make assumptions
- Example questions:
  - "Should we handle the case where...?"
  - "What's the expected behavior when...?"
  - "Do you want me to consider...?"

### 2. Challenge and Propose Alternatives
- **Challenge** if you see a different or potentially better strategy
- Present alternative approaches with pros/cons
- Don't just implement the first suggestion - explore options
- Example challenges:
  - "I see a potential issue with this approach because..."
  - "Have you considered using X instead of Y because..."
  - "This approach might be better because..."

### 3. Implement with Test-Driven Development
- **ALWAYS** write tests before implementation code
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  1. **Red**: Write failing tests that describe the desired behavior
  2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make tests pass
  3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green
- No production code without corresponding tests

### 4. Always Propose Working Plan
- **Before implementing any code**, present a detailed working plan
- Break down complex features into phases
- Get approval on the plan before starting implementation
- Include timeline and dependencies
